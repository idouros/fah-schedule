Schedule the Folding@Home client using Windows Task Scheduler

The timings are specific to the cheap electricity tariffs as they apply in Greece, namely:

11:00pm-7:00am in the summer period (May to October)
2:00am-8:00am and 3:00pm-5:00 pm in the winter period (November to April)

The "unpause" files will wake up the computer if necessary.

All you need to do is import the appropriate XML files into the Task Scheduler according to season.

You are very welcome to clone this repo and create your own schedules.
